# PROJECT: Implement an app with React

AUTHOR: Matthew Allen

## INTRODUCTION

This project contains a pocket movie app that keeps track of your favorite movies, and sets up a watch-later list using React.  The backend is hosted on a docker container.

## TASKS

### 0. Cloning the Figma project

### 1. Setting up the workspace - `README.md`, `package.json`, `public/`, `src/assets/`, `src/components`, `src/routes`, `src/App.js`

In this project, the `yarn` package manager is used, rather than `npm`.

* Using `yarn create` create your React app.
* Remove all the unnecessary files and their respective imports.
  * `src/App.test.js`, `src/reportWebVitals.js`, `src/setupTests.js`, `src/logo.svg`
* Make sure you App component returns an empty `div` with `className="App"`

#### Packages

This is the list of packages we will need throughout this project:

* `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core 6.1.0`
* `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons 6.1.0`
* `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome 0.1.18`
* `axios 0.26.1`
* `lodash 4.17.21`
* `normalize.css 8.0.1`

Install them and make sure they're added as dependencies.

#### Project Structure

This will be the general folder structuring.

* `public/`
* `src/`
  * `assets/`
  * `components/`
  * `routes/`

Make sure all your source files are under the repository root and not under a subdirectory.
